# WeightDataExploration

I created this project using R Shiny as a way to explore the weight data of my fiancé and I during and after a weight loss competition we challenged ourselves to do. To run it locally, you must download the code locally, open the code in RStudio or your favorite IDE that supports R, download all of the libraries used in the app (listed on the top), and change the setwd("...") to the path to wherever you stored the files on your computer. In addition, you will need to download the weights.csv file and move it into the directory where you are storing the code for this project in order to have access to the weight data.

Future additions to this project may include the addition of information on variables like, daily step count and calorie intake, as well as analysis on variables I began to add to the data set, such as hours slept and sleep score.
